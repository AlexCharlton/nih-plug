/// Describes a struct containing parameters and other persistent fields. The idea is that we can
/// have a normal struct containing [`FloatParam`][super::FloatParam] and other parameter types with
/// attributes assigning a unique identifier to each parameter. We can then build a mapping from
/// those parameter IDs to the parameters using the [`Params::param_map()`] function. That way we
/// can have easy to work with JUCE-style parameter objects in the plugin without needing to
/// manually register each parameter, like you would in JUCE. When deriving this trait, any of those
/// parameters should have the `#[id = "stable"]` attribute, where `stable` is an up to 6 character
/// (to avoid collisions) string that will be used for the parameter's internal identifier.
///
/// The other persistent parameters should be [`PersistentField`]s containing types that can be
/// serialized and deserialized with Serde. When deriving this trait, any of those fields should be
/// marked with `#[persist = "key"]`.
///
/// And finally when deriving this trait, it is also possible to inherit the parameters from other
/// `Params` objects by adding the `#[nested]` attribute to those fields. Parameter IDs and
/// persisting keys still need to be **unique** when usting nested parameter structs. This currently
/// has the following caveats:
///
/// - Enforcing that parameter IDs and persist keys are unique does not work across nested structs.
/// - Deserializing persisted fields will give false positives about fields not existing.
///
/// Take a look at the example gain plugin to see how this should be used.

///
/// This implementation is safe when using from the wrapper because the plugin object needs to be
/// pinned, and it can never outlive the wrapper.
